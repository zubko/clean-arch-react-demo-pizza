# List of next steps

- change title of add buttons if there are such items in the cart
- display cart
- checkout
- decide to use `getSmth` or just `smth`

# Later

- add E2E tests for existing features
- fix warning in storybook about React 18 (Storybook itself still uses React 17, so it will take time to remove the warning completely)
- show update status on the page without shifting the content down
- host FE/BE somewhere
- keep the currency knowledge somewhere in a formatter

# Maybe

- add date of last cart update and reset the cart on load if too much time have passed
- share data types between BE & FE
- data migration or reset on the client (when stored entities aren't correct anymore)
- entity description data with formatting including some React components
