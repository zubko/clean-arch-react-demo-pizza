# List of next steps

- upgrade the existing code to the newer organization from adding cart status
- write to rules about wireframes and views
- add exports to features
- add switch to product with re-fetching product data in background
- display cart

# Later

- fix warning in storybook about React 18 (Storybook itself still uses React 17, so it will take time to remove the warning completely)

# Maybe

- add date of last cart update and reset the cart on load if too much time have passed
