# List of next steps

- checkout

# Later

- add notifications (toast) system
- use product mock everywhere and generate other mocks
- add E2E tests for existing features
- fix warning in storybook about React 18 (Storybook itself still uses React 17, so it will take time to remove the warning completely)
- show update status on the page without shifting the content down
- host FE/BE somewhere
- keep the currency knowledge somewhere in a formatter
- consider dropping the index file of the feature as the types cannot be reexported easily

# Maybe

- add date of last cart update and reset the cart on load if too much time have passed
- share data types between BE & FE
- data migration or reset on the client (when stored entities aren't correct anymore)
- entity description data with formatting including some React components
- consider using Tailwind CSS or similar because the views are only used for presentation so the styling and the logic won't interfere
